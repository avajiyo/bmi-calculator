## What is BMI?

Body Mass Index, or **BMI** is used to determine whether you are in a healthy weight range for your height.
It is calculated using the formula:
```
_bmi = weight / pow(height / 100, 2);
```
Basically, it's your **weight** (kg) divided by the square of your **height** (m).

## How To Use The App

1. Open up the app 'BMI CALCULATOR'.
2. Select your Gender, Height, Weight, and Age.
3. Press 'Calculate'
- Underweight (<18.5) 
- Normal (18.5 - 24.9)
- Overweight (>25.0)
- (Note: This is only an estimate and it doesn’t take into account other factors such as ethnicity and waist measurement.)
