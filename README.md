# bmi_calculator in Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google.

## What is BMI? BMI stands for 'Body Mass Index'; it is used to determine whether you are in a healthy weight range for your height.
It is calculated as your weight (kg) divided by the square of your height (m).
